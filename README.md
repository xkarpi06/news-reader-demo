# News Reader App

## üéØ Objective

This is a simple Android application that loads news articles using the [NewsData.io API](https://newsdata.io/docs). The app is designed to handle a basic login flow and provide users with the ability to browse and view details of news articles, with additional features to share articles via other apps.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **Static Login**
- Users can log in using the static credentials:
  - **Email:** `news@demo.com`
  - **Password:** `Demo1234`
- If the credentials are correct, the app attaches an API key (X-ACCESS-KEY) to requests to the NewsData.io API.
- If the user skips the login, the news feed will not load, and a message will be displayed on the home screen prompting them to log in.

### 2. **Fetching News Articles**
- After successful login, the user is redirected to the main screen where a list of news articles from NewsData.io is loaded.
- News articles are loaded once and presented to the user as a summary list.

### 3. **Article Details**
- Users can click on an article to view detailed information.
- Each detailed article view includes:
  - Full title and description.
  - Source and publication date.
  - Option to share the article via available apps on the device (e.g., email, social media).

## üèÖ Bonus Features (Optional)
- Implement news pagination. When the user scrolls to the bottom of list, automatically load more news.
